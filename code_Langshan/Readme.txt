Dears users,

Here the explanation to use these matlab codes.

code : "kmeans_get_k"
--> Determine k (number of clusters) using the elbow method of k-means clustering.

code : "kmeans_4clusters"
--> If k is 4, the DHSs could be divided into 4 clusters. 

code "get_exposure_age"
--> Calculate exposure ages of samples of Langshan bedrock fsult scarps.

code "get_steady_erosion"
--> Calculate steady erosion rates of samples.

The txt data shows the OSL-depth actually measured.

Please contact me for any informations: luomingearth@163.com

Cheers,
